# üßπ Cleaning Up AWS Resources

I have completed the **Introduction to Cost Management** section.  
To **avoid unnecessary charges**, I will now clean up all the resources I created.

> **Note:**  
> If I used an **AWS-provisioned account for an event**, cleanup is not required.  
> If I completed this workshop **in my own AWS account**, I must **follow these steps** to delete resources.
