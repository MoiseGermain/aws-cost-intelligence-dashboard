# üöÄ Deploying AWS Cost Intelligence Dashboards

## **Introduction**
In this section, I will deploy the **AWS Cost Intelligence Dashboards** using **AWS CloudShell** and **Amazon QuickSight**.  
This will allow me to visualize **AWS cost and usage data** efficiently.

üîπ **Why use AWS CloudShell?**  
AWS CloudShell is a **browser-based terminal** that is **pre-authenticated** with my AWS credentials and comes with pre-installed tools, making it easy to deploy AWS resources **without additional setup**.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Open AWS CloudShell**
1. Navigate to **[AWS CloudShell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home)**
2. Wait for CloudShell to initialize.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Explore the Dashboard Visuals
Since this is fabricated data, some of the visualizations may not align with real-world AWS costs.
I will navigate through each tab to explore different cost breakdowns and usage trends.
