# üìä Setting Up AWS Cost Explorer

In this section, I'll set up **AWS Cost Explorer**, which provides powerful visualization and analysis tools to understand my AWS costs and usage patterns. Using Cost Explorer, I'll be able to quickly generate custom reports, spot trends, identify cost drivers, and even receive resource recommendations for optimizing my infrastructure.
